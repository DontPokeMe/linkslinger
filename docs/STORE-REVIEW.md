# Chrome Web Store review – response and listing text

Use the following when replying to reviewers or updating the store listing.

---

## 1) Reply to reviewer (use verbatim)

**Where it is:** Options → Profiles → select **Bookmark** action.

**How it works:** Hold the configured trigger and drag to select links, then the Bookmark action saves them.

**Where bookmarks go:** Bookmarks Bar → LinkSlinger → YYYY-MM-DD.

**Safety:** Only http/https, deduped by URL.

## 2) Store listing – Permissions / Data section

Add this so the listing clearly matches the `bookmarks` permission:

**This extension can create bookmarks when you select the Bookmark action.**

---

## 3) Selection fallback for reviewers

Selection does **not** run on `chrome://`, Chrome Web Store, or other restricted pages. Use a normal HTTPS page (e.g. https://example.com).

Two default profiles open links in tabs so reviewers can use either:

- **Z** + drag (Default)
- **Shift** + drag (Default (Shift))

If Z does not work in their environment, Shift + drag is the fallback.
